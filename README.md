Gitcoin Grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/989/defier

Project details will be updated in the near future... but here is a general idea of the concept:

- Based in DeFi.
- Operating on Ethereum 2.0+
- Low to no transaction fees (Meta-Transactions).
- Staking for all users (no minimum balance to stake Ethereum)
- High compound interest on Ethereum and other major ERC20 tokens.
- Comparable savings rates to crypto-banks such as Nexo, Celsius, Crypto.com, etc. (around 4% compound interest on Ethereum savings).
- Significantly higher savings rates for many vital cryptocurrencies, compared to other options such as Compound and Nuo.
- Low, fairer, more convenient lending rates, up to 7% APR.
- Greater security.
- Largely, if not fully decentralized final product.
- Open-Sourced and Audited.
- Largely based on other Open-Sourced projects, shaped by users.
- Low-fee decentralized exchanging of Ethereum and other ERC20 tokens.
